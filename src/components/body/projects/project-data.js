This pipeline takes in the user's single-cell RNA-seq data as input, preprocesses the data, trains and optimizes the model, and outputs the prediction of cell-type. Different classification algorithms are implemented and hyperparameter tuning and cross-valication techniques are perform to increase the accuracy of the model. ",
